# Handwritten Digits Classification (k-NN)

This project implements the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm from scratch in Python,  
and compares it with scikit-learn’s implementation.  

The model is trained on the Digits dataset (8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0–9).

# Features
- k-NN implemented from scratch (no external ML libraries).
- Comparison with scikit-learn’s `KNeighborsClassifier`.
- Visualization of predictions vs actual digits.
- Accuracy evaluation on test data.
